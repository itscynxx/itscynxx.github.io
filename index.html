<h1>Cynthia/Cyn for short (aka cooldudepugs online)</h1>
<p>I'm a nerd that does nerd things</p>
<p>Notably, I'm a fairly active contributor to the <a href="https://github.com/R2Northstar/NorthstarWiki/commits?author=CooldudePUGS">Northstar Wiki</a>, a decently active helper in the <a href="https://northstar.tf/discord">Northstar Discord server</a>, and musician (viola and guitar)</p>
<p>I've also created an <a href="https://github.com/CooldudePUGS/Spectre">open source Discord bot</a> to automatically help users in the Northstar Discord server</p>
<p>Lately I've been working on learning new code languages, and notably upkeeping <a href="https://northstar.thunderstore.io/package/NanohmProtogen/VanillaPlus/">VanillaPlus</a>, a mod you can use with Northstar to load client side mods on Vanilla Titanfall 2 servers</p>
<p>I've also been writing up ideas and some small code for a game I'm working on</p>
<p>Maybe I'll make this website not garbage at some point but I was bored and wanted to learn HTML basics lol</p>
